Technologies:

    Express.js with TypeScript:
    Use Express.js as the backend framework and TypeScript for type safety and enhanced developer experience.

    Socket.io:
    Implement real-time updates to reflect changes made by different users in the task management system.

    Cron Jobs:
    Schedule cron jobs to send reminders or notifications for upcoming task deadlines.

    Redis:
    Utilize Redis for caching and storing real-time task updates, reducing the load on the database and enhancing performance.

    OAuth2:
    Implement OAuth2 authentication to allow users to sign in using their preferred authentication provider.

Features:

    User Authentication:
        Allow users to sign in using OAuth2 authentication with their preferred social media accounts.

        Assign tasks to specific users with real-time updates when tasks are created or updated.

    Real-time Updates:
        Implement Socket.io to provide real-time updates to users when tasks are created, edited, or completed.

    Cron Jobs for Notifications:
        Schedule cron jobs to send notifications or reminders for upcoming task deadlines.

    Redis Caching:
        Use Redis for caching task data and real-time updates to enhance the performance of the system.

    User Collaboration:
        Allow multiple users to collaborate on tasks, with real-time updates reflecting changes made by other users.

    Task Filters and Sorting:
        Implement filters and sorting options for users to organize and view tasks based on various criteria.

    Responsive UI:
        Create a responsive and user-friendly UI for the task management system.

    Error Handling:
        Implement error handling mechanisms for failed API requests, authentication issues, etc.

Technologies and Tools:

    Backend: Express.js, TypeScript, Socket.io, Redis, cron
    Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
    Authentication: OAuth2
